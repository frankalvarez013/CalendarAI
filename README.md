# CalendarAI
Using an AI API, we will create a schedule for the user to use based on what their queries which should align with a goal they want to accomplish, this will be based on a series of questions asked to the user. Once the AI developed schedule has been created we will then insert it into a Calendar which will then display dynamically if changed.
